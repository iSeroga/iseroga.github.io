    <p>Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
      Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.<br>
      As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.<br>
      They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.<br>

    <p id="second_article" class="info"><h1>GIT</h1>
    <p>create a new repository
      create a new directory, open it and perform a
      git init
      to create a new git repository.<br>
      <p>
      checkout a repository
      create a working copy of a local repository by running the command
      git clone /path/to/repository
      when using a remote server, your command will be
    git clone username@host:/path/to/repository</p>

      <p>workflow
        your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by git. the first one is your Working Directory which holds the actual files. the second one is the Index which acts as a staging area and finally the HEAD which points to the last commit you've made.</p>
        <p>add & commit
      You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using
      git add
        git add *
        This is the first step in the basic git workflow. To actually commit these changes use
        git commit -m "Commit message"
          Now the file is committed to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet.</p>

  Introduction<br>
  Node.js is a run-time environment which includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript. Itâ€™s used for running scripts on the server to render content before it is delivered to a web browser.

  NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is an application and repository for developing and sharing JavaScript code.

  This guide will help you install and update Node.js and NPM on a Windows system and other useful Node.js commands.</p><br>

      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
      It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.<br>
      [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]<br>
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
      [3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,<br>
      enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.<br>
